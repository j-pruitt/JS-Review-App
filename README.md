# JS-Review-App
HTML/CSS/JS Web Application for displaying reviews.

TO DO:
Add Media Qurries for Responsivness 
  (currently only really looks good in desktop view)
  
Clean up rough comments and temp code
  (house keeping...)

Here I have a web based application utilizing a JS array filled with mock user data. Buttons will trigger JS response to cycle through user data and display in html container.

I also took some time to play around with CSS Animations as seen when using the next and previous buttons
