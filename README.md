## JS-Review-App

JS-Review-App is a web-based application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to display and cycle through reviews. The app utilizes a JavaScript array filled with mock user data to showcase reviews in an HTML container.

## To-Do List

* Add Media Queries for Responsiveness: Currently, the app looks best in desktop view, and media queries need to be implemented to enhance responsiveness on different devices. 

* Clean Up Comments and Temporary Code: Conduct housekeeping by removing rough comments and unnecessary temporary code for improved code readability and maintenance.

## Features

* Dynamic Review Display: The app utilizes JavaScript to respond to buttons, cycling through the user data array, and displaying reviews in the HTML container.
  
* CSS Animations: Enjoy smooth CSS animations when using the next and previous buttons for a delightful user experience.

Feel free to explore, leave reviews, and contribute to the project! Any suggestions and improvements are highly appreciated.

## Local Reviews Data

The app features a collection of local reviews with the following structure:

```

const reviews = [
    {
        id: 1,
        name: "John Smith",
        job: "web developer",
        img: "your_image_url_here",
        text: "Your review text here...",
    },
    // Add more reviews as needed...
];

```


## How to Use

Open **index.html** in your preferred web browser.

Use the "Next" and "Previous" buttons to cycle through different reviews.
